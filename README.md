# Introduction to the `solmate` Contracts

## History

- Written by [t11s](https://xn--2-kmb.com/)
    - Famous for low-level gas optimizations & data-driven Solidity engineering
- Started as a project inside of RariCapital
- Then moved to t11s' private repo after they switched to Paradigm


## Disclaimer about Security

Copied from README:
```markdown
[...] these contracts are **not designed with user safety** in mind:

- There are implicit invariants these contracts expect to hold.
- **You can easily shoot yourself in the foot if you're not careful.**
- You should thoroughly read each contract you plan to use top to bottom.
```

Also:
- Little to no documentation

### Auditing Projects using `solmate`:

While `solmate` itself can be assumed to be secure (if using major version), the
contracts used should be studied carefully anyway in order to check that the
project uses them correctly.


## Philosophical Differences to `OpenZeppelin`

`OpenZeppelin`:
- Want to make it as hard as possible to misuse the contracts
    - Said by Nicolas Venturo in the `Devs Do Something` podcast
- -> Useful for every Solidity developer

`solmate`:
- Optimizes as much as possible for the **average** case
    - -> Misses checks for corner cases
- Highly opinionated
- -> Should only be used by experienced Solditiy developers

### Personal Note

IMHO `solmate` does a really good job of not reinventing the wheel but instead
getting inspired from a ton of high quality and battle-proved projects.

## Comparison of Documentation: `solmate` vs `OpenZeppelin`

See `solmate/utils/ReentrancyGuard.sol` vs `OpenZeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol`.

`OpenZeppelin` provides a lot of in-code documentation explaining the
reasoning behind decisions (e.g. why are the lock's values `1` and `2`
instead of `0` and `1`?).

`solmate`: Links to the OZ repo :)

## `auth/Auth.sol`

Check comments inside code.

Problem:
If the `Authorizer` instance is compromised, the whole `Auth` system is
compromised because it can make `canCall()` calls always fail (e.g. by using
all available gas).

Even the owner can not change the `Authority` anymore!

## `tokens/ERC20.sol` & `tokens/ERC721.sol`

Check comments inside the code.

Problem:
Invariant is not enforced in order to save gas and give downstream contracts,
i.e. user/developers, more power over internal state.
BUT with great power comes great responsibility ðŸ•·

## `utils/SafeTransferLib` or: How I learned to stop worrying and love assembly ðŸ’£

Check comments inside the code.
